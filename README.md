Norwegian Company “Ask Abuoy” Lock Manufactures since the year 2012. However, the
work culture of the company has been Australian and has not changed a lot since its
acquisition by Ask Abuoy. Initially the partnership was very successful due to work culture
of both Nordic nations and Australians being quite similar. However, recent developments
and changes have made the company’s profitability tank. This includes changes in
government policies, change in labor due to the older generations retiring in masse, change in
work force and culture and impacts due to Covid. Hence, Lock Hood now faces the risk of
